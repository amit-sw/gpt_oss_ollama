# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Summary
A minimal, ready-to-run Streamlit application to bootstrap local development. Deliverables are limited to four root-level files: `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, and `.gitignore`.

## Goals
- Provide a simple Streamlit app that runs with one command.
- Keep code compact and self-explanatory, with good, configurable logging.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies and complexity.

## Non-Goals
- Multi-page navigation, auth, databases, or external services.
- Cloud deployment or containerization.
- Extensive docs beyond a concise `README.md`.

## Key Use Cases
- Developer clones the repo, installs requirements, and runs the app locally.
- Developer can adjust logging level quickly for debugging.

## Requirements
- Show an app title and brief description.
- Provide at least one interactive widget (e.g., text input) that updates the UI.
- Log key interactions/events at INFO level by default; allow DEBUG via env var.
- Run with: `streamlit run app.py`.

## Deliverables
- `app.py`: Single-page Streamlit app with basic UI and logging.
- `requirements.txt`: Pinned dependencies.
- `README.md`: Quickstart.
- `.gitignore`: Python + Streamlit appropriate ignores.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Fresh environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt` then `streamlit run app.py` works without errors on macOS (Python 3.10+).
- Interactive widget visibly changes output and triggers log entries.
- Logging level changes via environment variable (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`).
