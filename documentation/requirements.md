# Requirements Document

## Summary
Populate this repository with a basic Streamlit setup. No documentation in the final deliverable; only these code files are required:
- app.py
- requirements.txt
- README.md
- .gitignore

## Objectives
- Provide a minimal, working Streamlit application that can be run locally with `streamlit run app.py`.
- Keep the implementation simple, compact, and easy to read.
- Include basic logging that is configurable (level and destination) while remaining minimal.

## Scope
- In-scope:
  - A single-page Streamlit app with a simple UI: title, description, a small interactive widget, and visible log outputs when appropriate.
  - `requirements.txt` with pinned versions sufficient to run on macOS.
  - `README.md` with short setup and run instructions.
  - `.gitignore` appropriate for Python/Streamlit projects.
- Out-of-scope:
  - Cloud deployment, CI/CD, or containerization.
  - Authentication, database integration, or complex state management.
  - Extensive documentation beyond `README.md`.

## Constraints
- Code should be simple and self-explanatory; avoid comments by preferring clear structure and naming.
- Logging must be present and configurable (level at least). Prefer console output by default.
- No extra dependencies unless justified. Prefer the standard library plus Streamlit.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Repository contains exactly the four requested files at the root: `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`.
- Running `pip install -r requirements.txt` followed by `streamlit run app.py` starts the app without errors.
- The app shows a title, brief description, and at least one interactive element (e.g., text input or selectbox) that updates the page.
- Logging can be changed between INFO/DEBUG through an environment variable or a simple mechanism.
- `README.md` includes concise instructions for setup and running the app locally.

## Assumptions
- Python 3.10+ is available locally on macOS.
- Internet access is available to install dependencies from PyPI.
